      			The first professional experience I had was in Ocala, Florida at a startup named
            Veterans Trading Company during the summer of 2015. I worked as an Engineering Intern
            with a focus on software development and databases. My summer-long project digitalized
            their warehouse receiving operations. I created software that allowed the receiving
            operators to quickly scan parts with hardware and find them in a database. This allowed for
            more accurate inspections when searching for counterfeit and fraudulent parts. Afterwards, I
            had the opportunity to prepare documentation and present my project to an auditor
      			personally. It was a greatly unique experience, and I'm happy to say that I successfully
            helped the company pass two audits: AS9100 and AS6081.

            During the Fall, I'm be working as a software developer at GE's Energy Management
            Division in Melbourne, FL. I was very fortunate to be able to interview with the Aviation
            team at the SHPE 2015 conference. While they did not have room for me during the fall, they
            passed me off to the wonderful Energy Management team. I'm working on extremely interesting
            projects like developing Smart Grids. Furthermore, I'm also a part of the leadership program.
            By the end of this, I'll have tremendous experience with leading teams and being an all around
            better professional and engineer.
